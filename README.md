# Ecotox-Periphytic-Biofilms

Summary

This repository serves as a supplement for the textbook chapter "Incorporating biofilms into ecotoxicological models" in the the textbook [Insert name of textbook]. There are two primary arms of the repository.

1)  Numerical method technique explainers and associated python scripts
2)  Original data from highlighted case-study

Numerical Technique Explainers

This arm of the repository deals with the numerical techniques for use in implementation of the ecotoxicological models developed using the framework outlined in the chapter. This arm of the repository has two primary components.

The first component is the explanations of how to implement these techniques in practice using the python coding language in the SPYDER IDE with the Anaconda distribution platform. These explanations are found in the wiki section of the repository.

The second component of the numerical techniques arm of the repository are the python scripts referenced either directly in the textbook chapter or in the numerical technique explainers. These scripts can be found in the files section of the repository.

Case-Study Data

This arm of the repository contains all the recovered original data from the case-study [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.02.004]. This sections serves two purposes.

First is for students to use if they would like to try to recreate the original case-study starting from the original data. Future iterations of this chapter/repository might contain explanations/codes on how to recreate the original modeling work in the case-study directly from the given data. However, in the meantime, the author's would like the data in the public domain for anyone interested in its use.

The second reason for including the original data is because prior to the publishing of this repository, this data was not publically available. The author's thought it was important to make find and make this data publically available for a variety of reasons. The primary reason was because data accessability is an important aspect of modern science, and this further's this aim. The second is that this data is particularly important for biofilm ecotoxicological modeling. Few studies have tracked biofilm (here periphyton) ecotoxicant concentrations over long periods of times in natural settings. In addition, this study tracked ecotoxicant concentrations in species above periphyton in the trophic hierarchy, allowing for dietary transfer to be studied quantitatively. More generally however, this study quantified ecotoxicant concentration in a (relatively) complex ecosystem. This allows for experimental testing of the ecotoxicant arm of the modelling framework from the textbook chapter. While it can't be used for testing the other two arms of the FTE modeling framework introduced in the textbook chapter, almost no single data-set exists that could test an ecosystem scale FTE such as that.

As mentioned in the textbook chapter, the authors would like to thank those who helped us track down the original data from this study. These include:

Prof. Thomas Hinton (Fukishima University)
Prof. Thomas Johnson (Colorado State University)
Linda Lee (Savannah River Ecology Laboratory)

We would also like to again acknowledge the contributions of Dr. John Pinder III. While he is no longer with us, his work utilizing the Pond 4 study was instrumental in the development of this book chapter.
